# ðŸŽ¸ Bringing AI to Music: Classifying Guitar Chords with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)! ðŸŽ¶
The objective of this model is creating a CNN model that helps classify different guitar chords from this kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabianavinci/guitar-chords-v2

# ðŸ“Š Pipeline Overview
1. Audio Data Preprocessing:
Converted audio files to a consistent format and sample rate using librosa and ffmpeg.

Extracted MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features, which are crucial for capturing the spectral properties of audio signals.

Converted the audio files to spectrogram in order to feed them to the CNN model.

2. Model Architecture:
   
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.

The model includes layers for feature extraction and classification, leveraging the CNNâ€™s ability to identify patterns in MFCC data.

3. Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained the CNN on labeled datasets with guitar chords.

Achieved an impressive 95% validation accuracy, demonstrating the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between chords like Am, C, G, and more. And 94% accuracy on testing dataset.
